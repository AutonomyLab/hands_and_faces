## Training Data
* We created the Autonomy Hands and Faces dataset, consisting of 16,883 images, with human-annotated labels for 34,588 hands and 18,838 faces.
* In a semi-supervised manner, we used an initial model trained on the previous dataset
to label more data from third party datasets*, resulting in 50,365 frames, with 94,854
hand and 58,210 face labels.

## Test Data
* Data from human-UAV interaction over 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, and 20.0 meters.
